# Search operators

Googling is a good skill. Thus, we need to know how to use google efficiently. One of the most important keys of the googling skill is search operators.

## Search operators: They are symbols used in your google search to specify what you want to look for. They really help when you want to search for a specific
topic/question. The idea of search operators is similar to command line switches/options.

Notes:
1. Google ignores punctuation marks.
2. Don't put spaces between ticks and option. (obviously :))

## -

This is for execluding a word from your search.

## | 

OR, which gives results of both sides.

## @ 

For a specific social media site. For example: **FaZeSway @twitter**. This will search for FaZe Sway and give the results from 
twitter.

## " text "

To search for the exact same text.
