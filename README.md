# useful_articles

## This is a repository for summaries that I write about stuff that I've learnt. 

### The main aim of this repository is to make a reference for me to refer to when I need to memorize something that I've already learnt. This way, I won't need to google stuff over and over again. 

Note: Building this repository will be so slow at the beginning as I'm getting pressure form college work, but soon I'll be great.
